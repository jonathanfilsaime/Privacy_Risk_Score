Consider using a password manager. Programs or web services like RoboForm (Windows only) or Lastpass (Windows and Mac) let you create a different very strong password for each of your sites. But you only have to remember the one password to access the program or secure site that stores your passwords for you.\n Consider using multi-factor authentication. Many services offer an option to verify your identity if someone logs on to your account from an unrecognized device. The typical method is to send a text or other type of message to a mobile device registered to you with a code you need to type in to verity it's really you. In most cases you will not be required to use this code when logging on from a known device such as your own computer tablet or phone.\n "connectsafely.org",<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0GeMSFGIgI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>,authentication

Privacy settings\nTrend Micro noted in a blog post that one critical step is to investigate available privacy settings.\n\n"The first thing you'll need to do is to go by the rule of thumb and set your privacy to the highest level to make it harder for attackers to target you" Trend Micro stated.\n\nA Trend Micro white paper "How to Protect Your Privacy on Social Media" noted that privacy policies can be especially telling and can help users understand just how accessible their information is. Privacy policies typically outline what data the platform collects how these details are gathered how long this information is stored as well as the built-in security the website offers. Because social media entities can change these policies at will it's important to regularly check for any adjustments.\n\nThink before you share It's also important to thoroughly consider the impact a social media post might have before sharing. This extends to a user's friends and family as well as any hackers that might be looking to cash in on a person's carelessness.\n\n"Oversharing online might do damage to your reputation" Trend Micro stated in the white paper. "For example your family or employers might spot carelessly posted photos of yourself in compromising situations. Your details can also be used for identity theft if cybercriminals utilize them to impersonate you."\n\nIn the past criminals have also used this information for real-world crimes. For instance if a user posts on social media that they'll be out of town for a few days a burglar might use this information to their advantage and break into the person's hose while they are away. One Trend Micro survey found that only 38 percent of users understand how to limit their online postings. This illustrates that many are sharing more data than they should or intended to. For these and other reasons it's critical to think before you share.\n"trendmicro.com",<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UhhYSrUHnao?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>,social media
How to Help Secure Your Smart Home\n1. Secure your network. Smart things need to connect to the Internet and most of us use Wi-Fi for that. If your home Wi-Fi network isn't secure then your private information isn't either. Be sure to turn on Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA2) encryption protocol when setting up your Wi-Fi and use a router that offers firewall protection whenever possible. While you're at it change the preset username and password. You can typically learn how to do this by going to your provider's website and doing a search for "how to change Wi-Fi password." Depending on your Wi-Fi gateway you may also be able to create multiple network identities. Think about which devices you use to transact. If you shop and bank online you could create one network for the devices you use to transact and another for smart devices which may have more vulnerabilities.\n\n2. Know your devices. Make sure you understand what capabilities your smart devices have. You may not be comfortable with all of them. For example some smart TVs are able to listen to your conversations. Disable these features to suit your comfort levels usually by going to the Settings menu. Also modify the privacy and security settings according to your needs. And be sure to install updates when you receive notifications.\n\n3. Install security software. Internet security software may not work with all smart devices but it does with the most important ones: your PC Mac smartphone and tablet. Many trusted computer security companies make software that can protect multiple devices including your smartphone. Even when your Wi-Fi network is secure it won't be able to protect you from the types of malware that could infect your computers. Use security software and be sure to update to the latest versions promptly whenever you receive notifications. These updates are often released in response to major online threats that require software companies to issue patches.\n\n4. Secure your smartphone. It goes without saying that you should already be using strong passwords on all your devices. Even so many people still do not use passcodes to lock their smartphones — 33% according to the Norton Cybersecurity Insights Report. Almost all IoT devices are controlled by a smartphone app so mobile phones have become key entry points to our smart households — and in the case of smart locks they're actually the keys to our physical homes. Imagine if your un-password-protected smartphone fell into the wrong hands and you hadn't logged out of the app that unlocks your front door. So it's more critical than ever to keep smartphones secure. Before purchasing products or installing apps even those to control your connected home read the Privacy Policy to see what types of data the app will access from your smartphone what data it will collect and what will be done with that data.\n"us.norton.com",<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/udPNjvDiyrQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>,devices
